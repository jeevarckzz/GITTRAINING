Ponniyin Selvan (transl.?The Son of Ponni) is a Tamil language historical fiction novel by Indian author Kalki Krishnamurthy. It was first serialised in the weekly editions of Kalki, a Tamil magazine, from 29 October 1950 to 16 May 1954 and later integrated into five volumes in 1955. In about 2,210 pages, it tells the story of early days of Chola prince Arulmozhivarman. Kalki visited Sri Lanka three times to gather information and for inspiration.
Ponniyin Selvan is regarded as one of the greatest novels of Tamil literature.[1] The fan-following for the series, which was published weekly in Kalki, was such that it elevated the magazine circulation to a figure of 75,000 copies – a vast readership in a newly independent India.[2] The book continued to be admired in the modern era, developing a cult following and fanbase among people of all generations. Ponniyin Selvan has garnered critical acclaim for its tightly woven plot, vivid narration, witty dialogue, and portrayal of the intrigues and power struggle of the Chola empire in the 10th-century.
The novels were adapted into two films by Mani Ratnam by condensing the first two volumes into Ponniyin Selvan: I, and volumes 3 to 5 into Ponniyin Selvan: II, which were released on 30 September 2022 and 28 April 2023 respectively.
The first publication of the Ponniyin Selvan series outside of Tamil Nadu was released in 2022, published in Malaysia by Jaya Bakti.[3]
